# Cyclistic Trilogy

*(This document is still in development. It as a guide into what I am currently doing, rather than a retelling of what I did.)*

## Executive Summary
To learn and compare different data analysis tools, I repeated the same analysis (differences in bike usage between casual users and annual members for a Chicago-based bike-share programme) three times, each time with different set of tools and, as a result, a slightly different approach to analysis:
1. **[SQL → Google Spreadsheets → Tableau.](trackA)** A exploratory data analysis based on a statistical sample.
2. **[Excel → Power BI.](trackB)** in-depth analysis (full dataset) prioritising cleaning and preparation as a steppingstone into the ability to analyse LOADS of data in a straightforward-yet-comprehensive manner.
3. **[Python → MicroStrategy.](trackC)** I'm not done with this one just yet, but it is looking rather statistical.  

## Structure
The analysis is part of [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). I therefore used Google’s approach to data analysis, composed of six phases: ask, prepare, process, analyse, share, and act.

## Data analysis
For details about the data analysis, see the folder for each analytical track:
* [SQL → Google Spreadsheets → Tableau](trackA)
* [Excel → Power BI](trackB)
* [Python → MicroStrategy](trackC).

## Meta-analysis (lessons learned)
TBD.

## Conclusions
TBD.
